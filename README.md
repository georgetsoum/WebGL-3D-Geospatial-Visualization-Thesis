# WebGL-3D-Geospatial-Visualization-Thesis
This thesis presents the design and implementation of a WebGL-based application for three-dimensional visualization of geospatial data, focusing on the interactive representation of island relief routes and related information. Using technologies such as Three.js and React, the project delivers an intuitive, web-accessible platform that enhances user engagement through immersive 3D graphics. The work includes a detailed analysis of the system architecture, implementation challenges, and performance evaluation, culminating in a usability study that validates the applicationâ€™s effectiveness. The results demonstrate significant potential for applications in geospatial data visualization and digital cartography.
